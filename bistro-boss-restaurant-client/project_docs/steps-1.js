/*
## Create axios instance and interceptor + ...
~ create a server --> create an api to get menu items by category and limit --> now call this api from client, i will call this api from multiple place so i will create a hook to make it easy to call.

## Now i will fix the tab functionality

## Let's do something when a user click on the ADD TO CART button
~ when a user add a item to the cart > add this item to the cart collection\---> 
~ display the number of added items in the cart.
~ Create dashboard: maintain role > organize folders > create necessary files
~ now i will display cart items in my cart page. --> create an api to get cart data from db > show them in simple table 
~ create delete funtionality to delete items from cart
~ Work with an admin route: manage users --> here display all users. --> delete users --> update users role |
=> Now I will check : am i an admin ? 
=> I want to secure some api
~ so I will use jwt() | install jwt token and require it(???)

=> Create a JWT token and save it on local storage
~ create jwt token: go to jwt repo --> create a token(server) and send it with res. --> recive this token and save it in the local storage and when log out remove this token
~ now i will send the token with request: so that (Request Config)using `headers (`headers` are custom headers to be sent) i will send it to the server --> verify the token in a middleware -->
